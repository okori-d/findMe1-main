# FindMe: Campus Navigation App
**FindMe** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help university students navigate and locate areas of interest on campus efficiently. The app addresses the common problem of students struggling to find specific offices, facilities, or services, often wasting time being shuffled between distant locations.

## Key Features
**Location Catalog:** Browse a catalog of key locations on campus, including administrative offices, gyms, pools, and other facilities.

**Geofencing Notifications:** Receive real-time notifications when you are within a specified range of a selected location using geofencing technology.

**Service Details:** View detailed information about each location, including the services offered (e.g., student portal support, gym access).

**Efficient Navigation:** Save time by getting directed to the right place without unnecessary back-and-forth.

# How It Works
Students open the app and browse the catalog of locations.

They select a location of interest (e.g., an office for student portal issues).

Once the location is confirmed, the app sets up a geofence around the area.

When the student enters the geofence, they receive a notification with details about the location and the services available.

# Technologies Used
**Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)

**Backend:** Firebase (for data storage and geofencing)

**Tools:** GitHub (version control and collaboration)
